Hi there! I'm Natassia, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a mother, soon to be wife, homeschooling teacher, wannabe farmer, and homesteading greenhorn, with a passion to live a simple, self-sufficient lifestyle.

I grew up in Southern California where everyone is always in a rush and convenience is at your fingertips; however, my heart longed for the outdoors. I longed to be out in nature, and needed to rewind in time a bit. After years of dreaming, researching, and planning, my family and I made the leap: moving to a rural Oklahoma homestead to live  a simpler  life.

Now I spend my days tending to my garden, raising chickens, rescuing and rehabilitating horses, and working on various homesteading projects. I'm highly passionate about consuming anything and everything grown and cultivated with my own two hands, and enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with others who are also interested in living a more self-sufficient lifestyle.

When I'm not working on my mini farm, I am homeschooling my wonderful daughters. In the spirit of Charlotte Mason, we love to spend as much of our day outside as possible playing and learning in the real world. I’m also an avid reader, and love learning about Charlotte Mason and her timeless philosophy.

Through this blog, I hope to inspire and educate others on the joys and challenges of turning back time and appreciating a more old fashioned way of life. Whether you're a seasoned homesteader or just starting out, my goal is to provide practical advice, tips, and resources to help you achieve your own self-sufficiency dreams. I believe that we can all learn from each other and work together to create a more sustainable and resilient world; and of course there is nothing quite like the satisfaction of being able to provide for yourself and your loved ones with food and products that you've grown and made with your own two hands.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to connecting with you!
