Hi there! I'm Natassia, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a mother, soon to be wife, homeschooling teacher, wannabe farmer, and homesteading greenhorn, with a passion to live a simple, self-sufficient lifestyle.

I grew up in Southern California where everyone is always in a rush and convenience is at your fingertips; however, my heart longed for the outdoors. I longed to be out in nature, and needed to rewind in time a bit. After years of dreaming, researching, and planning, my family and I made the leap: moving to a rural Oklahoma homestead to live  a simpler  life.

Now I spend my days tending to my garden, raising chickens, rescuing and rehabilitating horses, and working on various homesteading projects. Aside from homesteading, I have a passion for sustainable living and preserving traditional skills. I love to crochet, and make soap, and I am always looking for new ways to reduce waste and live a more eco-friendly lifestyle.

When I'm not working on my mini farm, I’m tending to my children and homeschooling them Classically. We love to spend as much of our day outside as possible, playing and learning in the real world. I’m also an avid reader, and I love learning about Charlotte Mason and her timeless philosophy; she is a major inspiration in my homeschooling journey. You might also find me at my weekly prayer group, reading my Bible, and nurturing my faith through God’s living word. My Christian faith is sacred to our family, and my SO and I raise our daughters accordingly.

Through this blog, I hope to inspire and educate others on the joys and challenges of turning back time and appreciating a more old fashioned way of life. Whether you're a seasoned homesteader or just starting out, my goal is to provide practical advice, tips, and resources to help you achieve your own self-sufficiency dreams. I believe that we can all learn from each other and work together to create a more sustainable and resilient world; and of course there is nothing quite like the satisfaction of being able to provide for yourself and your loved ones with food and products that you've cultivated with your own two hands.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to connecting with you!
